# AI BioSpecimen Pipeline

### Dataset
The dataset is stored locally in the `data/` folder but is not pushed to GitHub.  
To re-download it, run the Roboflow script provided in `trials.ipynb` with your annotated data and roboflow api key.

The artifacts/ directory, which stores downloaded datasets and intermediate pipeline outputs, is excluded from version control via .gitignore to avoid pushing large files to the repository. It will be automatically generated when the pipeline is executed.
